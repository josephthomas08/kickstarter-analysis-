# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.
performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends 

#Kickstarting with Excel

The course has kickstarted with deep dive into excel, which will help me better understand, utilize, and handle a large amount of data in the Data Analytics course and varied industry data we will take.

We are exposed to in-depth analytical tools available within Excel in the first course, and we mainly studied to
import data into a table for analysis, 

Apply filters, conditional formatting, and formulas. 

Generate and interpret pivot tables.
Calculate summary statistics such as measures of central tendency, standard deviation, and variance.
Characterize data to identify outliers in datasets.
Perform an Excel analysis with visualizations.
Interpret common Excel visualizations
The Kickstarter data was downloaded into a folder as detailed in the course folder to assist Louise in analyzing the extensive data and advising her about the best approach for promoting and going forward with her crowdfunding project.
The data was resized into useful tabular data to understand the content of the data better.
##Overview of the Project 
Louise is interested in seeing from the data provided in the Kickstarter challenge how different campaigns in the chart have fared about their launch dates and their funding goals.

###Purpose 
The purpose of this exercise is to understand better the funding goals of the Louise Play Fever Project. Louise will like to have a dashboard approach to make a calculated assessment to launch her play successfully.


## Analysis and Challenge 

**When we filter for country-specific United States campaigns, we will find 525 successful theatre Kick starters.
**Further on evaluating the Greater Britain theatre campaign, we noticed that we just had a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in the "theatre" category that was successful.
**The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May, but that was not giving us a clear indication that it could be the best launch month as failures were equally prominent 
**We used filters with specific searches to view data just for theatres and plays.
**We were able to visualize better that theatre was a popular and successful type of campaign overall. The spike in the successful campaign was monitored in June and tapered off by the end of the year.

###Analysis of outcomes based on Launch Date.

**The analyzed result showed an overall 839 successful campaigns with 493 failures. 
**The month of June showed promise of more considerable success for a campaign similar to what Louise was looking for.

###Analysis of outcomes based on Goals.


Louise estimated the funding needed for the project to be $12,000 while most of the successful project was in the median and mean range of $5,000. 
The goal bracket of $10,000 to $14999 shows a success possibility of 54% while failure chances of 45%.
The highest success visualized is for the project's Goal under $5000, which is 72.66%.

### Challenges and difficulties encountered 
From statistics studies, we could have a better understanding of the large gap and number of failures.
Some large values were driving all of the distributions.
The standard deviation was roughly twice the IQR in each distribution except for the failed Kickstarter with very high goals.

## Results 
****What are the two conclusions you can draw about the outcomes based on the launch date?

The best available launch date was in June, tapering down by the end of the year. 
Failures were equally higher in those months, which will be a worry for Louise 

****What can you conclude about the outcomes based on the goals?

-	It was noticed from the outcome graph that success is highest for funding goal less than 5000

****What is the limitation of this data set

This data set's limitation is the insufficient evidence of the reason for failures in the same peak months of success. 
More data set on kind of plays successful over years and data fixed on changes in the backers_count profile will assist in better targeting the campaign.


****What are some other possible tables and or graphs that we could create.
A better understanding on backers and pledged will help to understand maximum backers in particular month.
